# Hello, Everyone!

Physics graduate that recently found out it's passion for coding 💻

Eagerly looking to dive into the tech world 🌐 

Studying front-end development (html, css, javascript (react, redux, D3.js)) at my freetime📝

Currently learning relational database (postgreSQL), Java, linux and bash 🐧

Already give a try to c++, pascal and python 👨‍💻 (and hope to continue studying)
